        <p>How deep does our cleaning service go? Well, it’s up to you! Our maid service for one-time home cleaning is
            highly customizable. Just let us know what you need, and we’ll tailor our work accordingly. Whether you
            require a single deep clean before you host a party or are hoping for a fresh start before spring, we’ve got
            you covered. Our typical checklist involves every room of the house, including the:</p>
        <div class="moving-cleaning-first-content mt-2 mb-5">
            <ul class="main-container">
                <li> <strong>Kitchen: </strong> From deep cleaning cabinets and appliances to scrubbing the
                    out-of-sight
                    corners of your kitchen, we’ll show you that no spot is too small for our care.</li>
                <li><strong>Bathroom: </strong> We pay special attention to sanitizing high-touch sections of bathrooms,
                    including sinks, bathtubs, toilets, mirrors, and countertops.</li>
                <li> <strong>Bedrooms: </strong> Dusting, vacuuming, and making the bed is where our bedroom cleaning
                    begins — but certainly not where it ends.</li>
                <li> <strong>Living areas:</strong> We’ll bring new life into your home’s living areas with thorough
                    furniture cleaning, vacuuming, sweeping, and dusting.</li>

        <h3>Spend Precious Time With Your Loved Ones</h3>
        <p>We’ve discovered that the real gift of house cleaning services isn’t the spotless home. It’s the valuable
            time saved. If you’ve got a heavy-duty cleaning blitz calling your name, hand over the to-do list. Free up
            your schedule for some quality time with family instead, and enjoy the more important things in life!</p>
